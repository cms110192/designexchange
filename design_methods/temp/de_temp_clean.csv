Listening is difficult work that we will not undertake unless we have deep respect and care for the other... we listen not only with our ears, but with our eyes, mind, heart and imagination, as well. We listen to what is going on within ourselves, as well as to what is taking place in the person we are hearing. We listen to the words of the other, but we also listen to the messages buried in the words. We listen to the voice, the appearance, and the body language of the other... We simply try to absorb everything the speaker is saying verbally and nonverbally without adding, subtracting, or amending.\r\n\r\n","Robertson K (2005).

Specifically, focus groups can be used during the following design phases: [[Understand]], [[Observe]], [[Realize]]Thus, there are 2 possible times to conduct focus groups:In the beginning during strategic research  when researching what the target market wants, focus groups are usually done after quantitative studies such as surveys, in order to explore statistics in greater depth.At the end after the creative executions are done, finding out how the target market perceives the finished product so that adjustments can be made before the product is released to the public.In addition, this method is often used as a complementary tool to interviews and observation.","Langford, Joe and Deana McDonagh.

66,Fused Deposition Models,Fused Deposition Modeling is a manufacturing technology used to create models and prototypes directly from CAD files.,"Purpose:\r\nA rapid prototyping process used to produce functional ABS thermoplastic models directly from CAD data. (1)\r\nProcess:\r\nThe build material, a production quality thermoplastic, is melted and then extruded through a specially designed head onto a platform to create a two-dimensional cross section of the model. The cross section quickly solidifies, and the platform descends where the next layer is extruded upon the previous layer. This continues until the model is complete, where it is then removed from the build chamber and cleaned for shipping. (2)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis should be used when the designer needs the part to be made of production-grade thermoplastics, such as ABS, ABSi, polyphenylsulfone (PPSF), polycarbonate (PC) and Ultem 9085, including PC-ABS.

There are several methods of gathering information about the users background, but the most effective method of identity construction is storytelling(1).\r\nIdentity Construction is best used in the phase of the design process in which UCD (User-centered Design) is more relevant.
