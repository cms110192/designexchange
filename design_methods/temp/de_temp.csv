In design, it&#39;s especially useful when conducting interviews.</p>\r\n","<p>Susan Knights defines free attention as: &lsquo;... placing all of one&rsquo;s attention and awareness at the disposal of another person, listening with interest and appreciating without interrupting.&#39;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	As Carl Rogers said in 1980: &lsquo;Attentive listening means giving one&rsquo;s total and undivided attention to the other person and tells the other that we are interested and concerned. Listening is difficult work that we will not undertake unless we have deep respect and care for the other... we listen not only with our ears, but with our eyes, mind, heart and imagination, as well. We listen to what is going on within ourselves, as well as to what is taking place in the person we are hearing. We listen to the words of the other, but we also listen to the messages buried in the words. We listen to the voice, the appearance, and the body language of the other... We simply try to absorb everything the speaker is saying verbally and nonverbally without adding, subtracting, or amending&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n","<p>Robertson K (2005). &quot;Active listening: more than just paying attention&quot;.
